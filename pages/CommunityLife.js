            At CityChurch we are passionate about helping people deepen their
            relationship with Jesus Christ and one another. Sunday is great, but
            church isnâ€™t just about Sundays. If you wanted to, you could slip in
            and out unnoticed each week, but we believe Jesus intends more for
            His church than that and we want to help you be apart of it. We
            believe that discipleship happens most efectively in the context of
            community and therefore want to encourage everyone who calls
            CityChurch their home to engage in our community life.
